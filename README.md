# Japanese Study Summaries: Daily and Monthly Automation

This repository automates the creation and delivery of processed summaries for daily and monthly activities, originally designed to assist with Japanese language study. By integrating spaced repetition principles and making study content relevant through summaries of daily activities, it provides a structured way to improve Japanese vocabulary, grammar, and comprehension.

## Features

### Daily Summary Workflow
- **Purpose**: Processes a daily file, compiles its content, and emails the result.
- **Functionality**:
  - Reads a specific day's processed file.
  - Emails the file's content, including vocabulary, translations, and grammar notes, to a specified recipient.
- **Trigger**: Can be run manually or scheduled to run daily.

### Monthly Summary Workflow
- **Purpose**: Compiles all processed files from a given month, performs vocabulary analysis, and organizes summaries.
- **Functionality**:
  - Collects and aggregates all daily summaries for the month.
  - Uses OpenAI API to analyze vocabulary, providing frequency, romaji, and definitions.
  - Combines the vocabulary analysis and summaries into a single file.
  - Stores the file in a `monthly-summaries` directory.
  - Sends the summary file's content via email.
- **Trigger**: Can be run manually or scheduled to run on the 1st of every month.

## How It Works
This project helps integrate **spaced repetition** with meaningful study content:
1. **Daily Relevance**: Summaries are derived from daily activities, ensuring that the study material reflects familiar, real-world contexts.
2. **Vocabulary Frequency Analysis**: The monthly workflow analyzes recurring words to highlight key vocabulary for further reinforcement.
3. **Integrated Email Delivery**: Automates delivery of summaries for consistent review.

## Directory Structure

- **`processed/`**: Contains daily processed files.
- **`monthly-summaries/`**: Contains monthly summary files generated by workflows.

## Usage

### Daily Summary
1. **Manual Trigger**:
   - Go to the GitHub Actions tab.
   - Select the "Send Daily Summary Email" workflow.
   - Input the date (optional) and run the workflow.
2. **Scheduled Trigger**:
   - Runs daily at 10:00 AM UTC, sending the previous day's summary.

### Monthly Summary
1. **Compilation Workflow**:
   - Automatically runs on the 1st of each month to compile the previous month's summaries.
   - Can also be triggered manually by selecting a specific year and month.
2. **Email Workflow**:
   - Sends the monthly summary via email after compilation.

## Environment and Secrets
To enable the workflows:
- **`OPENAI_API_KEY`**: API key for OpenAI GPT models.
- **`GMAIL_USERNAME`**: Gmail account for sending emails.
- **`GMAIL_PASSWORD`**: App password for the Gmail account.

## Example Outputs
### Daily Summary Email
- **Subject**: Processed Summary for YYYY-MM-DD
- **Body**: Includes the content of the day's summary file.

### Monthly Summary Email
- **Subject**: Monthly Summary for YYYY-MM
- **Body**: Includes vocabulary analysis and all compiled summaries.

## Purpose and Benefits
This project was created to:
- Enhance **Japanese language learning** by providing personalized and relevant study material.
- Utilize **spaced repetition** with frequent exposure to high-frequency vocabulary and grammar points.
- Ensure study material remains engaging and connected to the learner's daily life.
